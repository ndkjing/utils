# InsKalmanTutorials

The repository contains different Kalman filter examples for GNSS-aided Inertial Navigation Systems (INS).
There are seven examples (in separate folders) with increasing complexity, from a one-dimensional navigation system with one accelerometer and a position sensor to a 6-axis INS which estimates arbitrary movement in three-dimensional space.

Each example folder contains a main file "ins_em.py" which starts an emulation.
You can control target object movements by changing its trajectory and parameters of random noises.
